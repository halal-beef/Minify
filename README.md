# Minify

Minify is a mini spotify music player it isnt a complete replacement because you need spotify open.

To run it have music playing for a couple of seconds and then run minify and authenticate your spotify account.

Right now minify is a bit hit and miss in terms of running properly cause the api im using can be slow...

To Hide And Unhide Minify Press NumLock.

Known Bugs:

When Idle For Too Long The API Disconnects (Something I Cant Fix Cause Migrating Will Ultimately Mess Up The Whole Project)
